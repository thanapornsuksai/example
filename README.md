In this repository I had uploaded some software tool that I use to make me handle some data on my project easily. 
but I can't upload the main code of the project becasue of the company policy.

1.pidapcapture is a software tool for reading pcap file, we use it to check that the data was transfered in the correct format between
two server. (In this project I created external interface to tranfer data between platform that we have to colloect data from Thai's server then pack the data into the right frame format then send to other.
2.cassandra test is a software tool to insert csv file into the cassandra database.
